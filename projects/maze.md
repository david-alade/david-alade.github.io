 Maze is a visual representation of graph algorithms that I wrote in the spring of 2022 for my Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 class. It uses the java image library and it runs using the Khoury tester library function "big-bang".

Users start up the maze program and can press "b" for a breadth-first search or "d" for a depth-first search. Once one of those keys is pressed, the program searches for the "end" point which is at the bottom right of the maze.
