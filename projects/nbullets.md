 N bullets is a simple game that I wrote in the spring of 2022 for my Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 class. It uses the java image library and it runs using the Khoury tester library function "big-bang".

In N Bullets, a player can shoot "bullets" at "ships" that fly across the screen. If a bullet hits a ship, the ship explodes and turns a certain number and size of bullets that is determined by how many consecutive ships a certain bullet has hit. The goal is to destroy as many ships as possible with 10 bullets.
