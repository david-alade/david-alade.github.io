This Java Image Processor serves as a practical exploration into the intricate world of image manipulation, leveraging the power of Java combined with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Designed from scratch, this project provided insights into the MVC architecture, promoting clear role separations and more maintainable code. Delving deeper, the intricacies of pixel mathematics were uncovered, allowing for detailed adjustments in brightness, color balance, and filter applications. 

Furthermore, the project required an understanding of matrix transformations, fundamental for operations such as flipping and blurring. Challenges in image optimization were also addressed, specifically focusing on downscaling techniques to retain image quality while efficiently reducing file size. Overall, this processor illuminated the capabilities of Java in digital image manipulation, laying a solid foundation for future endeavors.
