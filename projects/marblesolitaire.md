Marble Solitaire is a text-based Java game that I wrote in the summer of 2022 for my Object Oriented Design class. 

The game can be played using either a triangular, European, or English board. Players can choose to move a marble from one position to another using the "move" command where "move 3 3 5 5" would move the marble from position (3,3) to positiion (5,5). A move only works if the spot that marble wants to move to is empty and if there is a marble in between the marble that is moving and the empty spot the marble is moving to. The marble in between the empty spot and the moving marble gets removed and a player wins when the board gets cleared.
